\section{PROJECTS}
	%{\sl High Altitude Balloon Telemetry Tracker }
	%	\begin{itemize} 
	%		\itemsep -2pt
	%		\item Personally developed hardware and software design and implementation
	%		\item Developing radio board to have the ability to use FSK, AFSK, or audio-based protocols
	%		\item Utilized multiple PCBs in order to separate functionality and increase reusability
	%		\item Can communicate GPS and other sensor data to the Amateur Radio APRS network
	%		%\item Required PCB design and construction, embedded programming, protocol implementation, RF implementation knowledge
	%	\end{itemize}
	
	{\sl Swerve Code for Team 1699}
		\begin{itemize} 
			\itemsep 0pt
			%\item Status: \textit{Completed, Awaiting Testing}
			\item Wrote the majority of the code for a swerve drivetrain (and accompanying libraries), which is a complex drivetrain where all wheels can turn 360\textdegree and are independently steered and driven.
			%\item PID loops were used in order to make motions smoother and to automatically adjust for drift.
			%\item Though we never got the physical modules to test the code, the code can be found on the Team 1699 GitHub.
		\end{itemize}

	%\vspace{-8pt}
	%{\sl ini-reader and ini-editor for Team 1699}
	%	\begin{itemize}
	%		\itemsep 0pt
	%		\item Status: \textit{Completed, Updated Often}
	%		\item Rewrote code to read configuration files stored on the robot. The original project was written in LabView, but it was rewritten in Java, and features were added in the process.
	%		\item The code has been used on the 2016 and 2017 competition robots, and in the swerve and autonomous projects.
	%		\item The ini-editor was designed to make the editing of configuration files on the robot easier, and the simulator was written to show how a configuration file would be interpreted.
	%		\item The editor was written in Python with Tk and the simulator was written in Java with JavaFX, and all code can be found on the Team 1699 GitHub.
	%	\end{itemize}

	\vspace{-8pt}
	{\sl RIT FIRST's Imagine RIT Project}
		\begin{itemize}
			\itemsep 0pt
			%\item Status: \textit{Work in Progress}
			\item Collaborated with other engineers and programmers to build small robots that play a game, similar to the game played by FIRST Robotics Competition teams, that are presented at Imagine RIT 
			%\item The robots use Arduinos, wireless modules, and servos to move around the field and manipulate game elements, while the field controller is a more powerful Arduino that controls the robots with user inputs and controls LEDs around the field.
			%\item The robots use Arduino C++, while the field controller uses Arduino C++ on the Arduino and Java for the user interface with the field controller.
		\end{itemize}
	\vspace{-8pt}
	{\sl WPILibPi}
		\begin{itemize}
			\itemsep 0pt
			%\item Status: \textit{Work in Progress, Early in Development}
