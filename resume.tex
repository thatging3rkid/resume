\section{PROJECTS:}

	%{\sl ini-reader and ini-editor for Team 1699}
	%	\begin{itemize}
	%		\itemsep 0pt
	%		\item Status: \textit{Completed, Updated Often}
	%		\item Rewrote code to read configuration files stored on the robot. The original project was written in LabView, but it was rewritten in Java, and features were added in the process.
	%		\item The code has been used on the 2016 and 2017 competition robots, and in the swerve and autonomous projects.
	%		\item The ini-editor was designed to make the editing of configuration files on the robot easier, and the simulator was written to show how a configuration file would be interpreted.
	%		\item The editor was written in Python with Tk and the simulator was written in Java with JavaFX, and all code can be found on the Team 1699 GitHub.
	%	\end{itemize}
	
	RIT FIRST's ImagineRIT Project
		\begin{itemize}
