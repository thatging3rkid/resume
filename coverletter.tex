Dear Hiring Professional, \\

\noindent
I am a second year student at the Rochester Institute of Technology in the Computer Engineering program. I am seeking a co-op position in the computer engineering field and I am available beginning May 15th through the end of December 2018. \\

\noindent
Through my coursework and personal projects, I found that I have a strong programming background, especially in C and Java. I have taken multiple programming courses, like the Mechanics of Programming and Introduction to Software Engineering and I have lots of personal software projects that have helped me grow my background. Additionally, I have taken or are taking classes like Digital System Design I \& II, Circuits I and Computer Organization to gain experience working with hardware. I also have strong interpersonal and leadership skills, which I gained during my time in FIRST robotics, where I was the co-captain of my FIRST Robotics Competition team for a year, and the lead for the controls sub-team for two years, including the year we won the Innovation in Controls award. My enclosed resume provides more details of my qualifications. \\

\noindent
I believe that I am qualified for your co-op position and I know that I would be a valuable asset to your organization. I can be contacted by email at me [at] connorhenley [dot] engineer. Thank you in advance for considering my application. \\

Sincerely, \\
Connor F. Henley
