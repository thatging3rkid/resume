To Whom it May Concern:\\

My name is Connor Henley and I am applying for the position of Resident Advisor at Rochester Institute of Technology.\\

\hspace{20pt}I have always being fascinated with computers. Right after starting 6th grade, I decided to join the LEGO Robotics program to expand my computing knowledge. As the years passed, I developed more skills with computers and electronics. It was a time when I believed that I could do anything with a computer. Moreover, it was also a period in which I found that my biggest challenge was interpersonal skills. For example, when I was building the grabbing device in 2015, it was taking a long time to assemble the subsystem. One of my mentors pointed out that I should be working in a team, instead of building it on my own. By delegating the work, the assembly was finished faster and we got more time to code and wire the robot. This experience showed me why it’s better to work in a team, which is a skill that RAs utilize to make residents have a better experience at RIT. \\

\hspace{20pt}RAs have to multiple important tasks to do. They need to assist in roommate agreements, health and safety checks and enforce the rules, just to name a few. But, RAs have other roles. During my first week here at RIT, some of my floor mates and I procrastinated dinner. It was late on a Sunday night and there was nothing open except for the Corner Store and we were hungry. So, we decided to go off campus and grab some dinner. It was a good time, everyone got something different to eat and it was a fun social experience. So, we did it the next week, and then decided to make it a habit. While it would be very difficult to do this on a weekly basis as an RA, it taught me the importance of social activities, the social jobs of an RA and why an RA is important for more than just doing room checks and roommate agreements. As an RA, your job is to make your resident’s time in dorms more enjoyable, either by organizing social events or helping residents make new friends.\\

\hspace{20pt}While in the RA position, there are some skills and qualities that I would like to improve. My time in FIRST robotics has given me some leadership experience, which could always be polished. I also feel that my public speaking skills could be refined while in the RA position. I believe that running events like floor meetings and get-together could better my public speaking skills, which would decrease the amount of stress I feel before having to give a presentation. Additionally, completing other tasks, like healh and saftey checks, guided conversations and competing rounds while being a full-time student, my time management skills could use enhancement and the RA position would help me reach that goal. With this position, the additional responsibilities would require me to plan my time more efficiently.\\

\hspace{20pt}In regards to the missions and values of the Center for Resident Life, I can adhere to all of them, especially the collaboration aspect. I believe collaboration helps us grow as individuals and it can help us in ways that we wouldn’t expect. For example, I was writing a program that reads data from a file in a programming language that I recently learned. For some reasons, my result values didn’t match the example output given by the professor, so I decided to ask a friend for help. While explaining what the code did, I noticed some of my flaws and he also pointed out other flaws that I didn’t notice. Not only did I learn how to code more efficiently, but I also learned more about collaboration, which reminded me that two heads are better than one and that all parties benefit (I increased my understanding of the new language, my friend gained more experience debugging programs). \\

\hspace{20pt}Overall, my experience and skills will allow me to help residents in the RA position. I can use my understanding of collaboration to show residents why it’s essential, even in everyday life. In addition, I can utilize my past mistakes to guide residents away from making the same ones such as procrastination.  Moreover, I believe the position will allow me to improve my public speaking and time management skills.

Thank you for considering me for this position.

Sincerely,

Connor Henley
