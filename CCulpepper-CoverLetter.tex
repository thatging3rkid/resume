%\opening{To Whom it May Concern:} 
To Whom it May Concern:
 
I am a student at the Rochester Institute of Technology in the 
Computer Engineering program, graduating in May 2017. 
I am seeking a position creating embedded software or hardware, designing
circuits, or systems engineering. 
 
\noindent 
As a student, I have completed many personal projects that have shown me that I
enjoy the creation of embedded systems. In particular, I have received great
enjoyment designing PCBs, writing the software and getting a working device at
the end of the journey. My Coop at SpaceX has shown me that I enjoy working in
the aerospace industry, probably because I read a lot of science-fiction as a
kid. My coop experience has proved that I am a hard worker that can adapt to
new situations quickly and with ease.

%the company, its products, services - above all, stress what  you
